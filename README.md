This is working token checker that can display email phone number etc.

*The Token-Checker is coded by me.

*To run this exploit you need to install requirements you can install it manual but i have install.bat here to install it automaticaly, next just open cmd and write "cd (YOUR FOLDER PATH HERE)"
and then just simply run exploit with "py main.py"
